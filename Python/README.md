## 🧮 Example Algorithm

### Binary Search

- **File**: `binarySearch.py`
- **Description**: Performs binary search on a sorted list to find the index of the target element.
- **Usage**:
    ```python
    def binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

    result = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)
    print(result)  # Output: 3
    
    ```
